      <description>UPDATE 2020:
This post is no longer accurate since I moved my website from Digital Ocean to Github Pages.
(this is actually how I ran my site in 2017 though)
 So I wrote a web server&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; and you&amp;rsquo;re using it right now! But wait, what is it exactly?
Well, think of it like an nginx of sorts.
I named it plexer because I wanted to experiment with multiplexing sockets, and it&amp;rsquo;s written in one of my favorite languages, C.</description>
