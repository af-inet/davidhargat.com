<p><strong>UPDATE 2020:</strong></p>
<p>This post is no longer accurate since I moved my website from Digital Ocean to Github Pages.</p>
<p>(this is actually how I ran my site in 2017 though)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-i-wrote-a-web-server">So I wrote a web server&hellip;</h2>
<p>&hellip; and you&rsquo;re using it right now! But wait, what is it exactly?</p>
<p>Well, think of it like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">nginx</a> of sorts.</p>
<p>I named it <a href="https://github.com/af-inet/plexer/">plexer</a> because I wanted to experiment with multi<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/poll.html#tag_16_363">plex</a>ing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">sockets</a>, and it&rsquo;s written in one of my favorite languages, C.</p>
<p>plexer will happily compile on either Linux or Mac. Just run <code>make</code> and watch it go!</p>
<p>The current implementation only serves your current directory.</p>
<p>So if you were to compile and run it right now - you&rsquo;ll see an index of the source files, something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/about-this-blog.jpg" alt="plexer running inside a terminal"></p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about it! I have it running on a cheap digital ocean droplet in a folder with a bunch of html (thats all this site is).</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://github.com/af-inet/personal/tree/master/bin">some scripts for deploying plexer</a> (packaged with my personal site) on debian. It&rsquo;s set up with a cronjob to poll my github and automatically re-deploy when I push any changes.</p>
<p>In the future I plan to write more posts detailing all the interesting things I&rsquo;ve learned (and am still learning) working on plexer.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-yourself">Try it yourself:</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git clone https://github.com/af-inet/plexer
cd plexer
make
./plexer -vp 8080 # verbose, run on port 8080
</code></pre><h2 id="security-concerns">Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Since plexer is strictly a for-fun project and isn&rsquo;t peer-reviewed whatsoever, it should go without saying that you SHOULD NOT use it in production unless you&rsquo;re looking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">some</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">fun</a>.</p>
<p>(Personally I&rsquo;m looking forward to the day someone exploits this)</p>
